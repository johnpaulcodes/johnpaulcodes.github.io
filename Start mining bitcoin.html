            <h1>Do You Have What it Takes to Mine Bitcoin?</h1>
                    <p>
                        There is a surge of new miners waking up to the oppurtunity that Bitcoin mining presents to them. If you think you have what it takes, chances are you probably do.
                        If you've landed on this page it is because you already have a basic understanding of Bitcoin and are ready to take the plunge as a miner. If you, by chance, are 
                        completely new to Bitcoin, it would be wise to first spend time understanding Bitcoin and it's underlying blockchain first before you break down the mining aspect. 
                        Like any new skill at first, it seems complex and unobtainable. Remember that this is a skill, and the more you expose yourself to the same subject, however, the more of an expert you will 
                        become as you dedicate the time. You must remember that this is an entreprenurial path to Bitcoin and involves tremendous risk if you ignore the numbers or neglect the 
                        power requirements and infrastructure this involves.

            <h1>How to get started!</h1>
                <p>
                    For this tutorial I will be keeping it simple and we will assume a residential mining operation 
                    of 200-amps or less in size. 
                    Bitcoin mining uses several useful every-day trade skills such as carpentry, plumbing, and electrician work to name a few. 
                    What skills are necessary depends on the complexity of your operation. To get started, you will have to become at the least knowledgeable across the 
                    following subjects to build your first operation without much headache. That being said, here are the things you will have to consider when 
                    implementing your first at-home mining operation. These are in order of significance (from my own personal opinion), 
                    though categorically, they are all equally important to understand.

                        <p>
                            To get started, a majority of new miners will likely be using grid-power to fuel operations. 
                            Grid-power is essentially the network of power cables owned by the big utility providors (speaking of the USA-grid) that are underneath our feet and powering our homes. 
                            This "grid power" as it's called is the most accessible to us plebians as it has had the most time to be developed for public use, first documented in the 1880's in fact. 
                            The ease of access, however, also makes grid-power the most expensive to consume. Most rates in the US range between $0.10c per Kilowatthour in Utah up to $0.24c per Kilowatthour in Rhode Island. We could go off-topic and get into how utility companies are essentially 
                            monopolies controling all the power that 99% of us need to use to power our homes but that is for a different article.

            <section id="energyConsumption" class="section">   
                <li><h2>Energy Consumption</h2></li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Energy Consumption</strong> is traditionally measured in Kilowatthours. If we were to translate this explain this to a 5 year-old, 
                        <em>Kilowatts</em> can be seen as the speed of a car while the <em>Hours</em> can be seen as the distance the car has traveled. 
                        Lets say 1 KilowattHour is equal to 1mph. If a car is moving at 1 mile-per-hour, then we can assume that in 5 hours it will have traveled a total of 
                        5 miles. Translating that to power consumption language, that would mean 1 Kilowatt of power used for 5 hours consumed a total of 5 KilowattHours of power which we will call the <em>Total Power Consumed</em>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To <strong>Calculate Costs</strong>, all we need to do is multiply <em>Total Power Consmption</em> 
                        by the energy rate your utility company has provided you.
                        If you have a power rate of $0.10c per KilowattHour, you would simply multiply

                            <ul>
                                <a title="Total Power Cost"><li>$0.10c x <em>Total Power Consumed</em> = Total Power Cost </li></a>
                            </ul>
                    </p>    
                    
                    <p>    
                        In this case, our total cost would be $0.50c since 5 KilowattHours multiplied by $0.10c gives us, $0.50c. 
                        Knowing how to do this simple math is the building block to determining 
                        operating costs. These are operational costs that you will have no matter what circumstances and there is no way around it. 
                        You <em>need</em> power for these ASIC's to work. This does not include overhead costs such as rent payments or having a backup rental-generator if 
                        you end up going that route (I don't believe it's necessary). If you are going to do this in a leased home, you absolutely need to contact your landlord and make sure it is okay first.
                        The chance of a fire is small if you do things the right way and don't overload things but of course you need to disclose things like this. Just a note.

                            Gone are the days to which mining Bitcoin was possible with a simple desktop computer. The only viable way to mine Bitcoin in year 2022 and beyond is using 
                            <strong>A</strong>pplication <strong>S</strong>pecific <strong>I</strong>ntegrated 
                            <strong>C</strong>ircuitboards, also known as <strong>ASIC</strong>s. You can purchase some from our store here.
                            There are several brands to choose from, but I will share only two of the most noteable and/or trusted manufacturers for incoming Bitcoin miners.
                        </p>  
                            
                            <h4>ASIC Manufacturers</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <strong><li>Bitmain</li></strong>
                                <strong><li>MicroBT</li></strong>
                            </ul>

                        <p>
                            Bitmain has a longer history of manufacturing ASICs over the last 5+ years, but MicroBT has recently been in the spotlight with their own ASICs that have proved
                            competetive in its hashing and efficiency capabilities compared to Bitmain. It is a known issue for MicroBT to produce more heat versus Bitmain's products but they are
                            also cheaper and take up less space (negligible space in my opinion). If I had the option I would just go with what has the most history and track record which would be
                            Bitmain as I think it is worth the extra dollars to have a more efficient machine in the long run. 
                            I also have not had a personal experience using MicroBT products, but I have not heard of any real complaints that would make it not worthwhile to acquire. If you have a lower
                            budget, then just go with MicroBT. Just know that they both will accomplish the same thing at the end of the day, just not to the same degree. You know what they say, <em>"you get what you pay for".</em>

                            Now that we know some of the numbers, we can begin to calculate both revenues and expenses to a certain degree. I will note that these still are 
                            ballpark numbers and you will still have to go deeper than this depending on variables like are you renting your location or own it? Do you have fixed or variable
                            energy costs? Now that you have that in mind, lets move on to mining difficulty and determining profitability.

                            <p>
                                The way to calculate your revenue share of Bitcoin depends on your mining pool. AntPool, F2Pool, & ViaBTC have in common a "guaranteed" payout based on your contributed hashrate.
                                Because the payouts are guaranteed, you will have to pay them a higher pool fee to participate. It is calculated as follows.
                                <ul>
                                    <a title="Block Reward Payout"><li>(Avg. Blocks per Day) x (<em>Your hashrate</em> / <em>Pool hashrate</em>)  - Mining Pool Fees = Block Reward Payout</li></a>
                                </ul>

                                <br>
                                In certain circumstances, like with SlushPool, you are only paid if the pool solves a new block. Because of this, you pay SlushPool a smaller 
                                mining pool fee to compensate for the additional risk of potentially solving <em>zero</em> blocks in a day, though this is highly unlikely.
                                We will use the Antminer S19j Pro for the example. Remember you can interchange these numbers 
                                with the MicroBT ASIC figures if you want.
                            </p>    
                                
                            <p>
                                Until block 810,000, each block subsidizes miners with 6.25 Bitcoin plus transaction fees.

                                The average number of blocks mined per day for the entire Bitcoin network is about 144 blocks. 
                                You can gauge how much of the entire Bitcoin network your Pool is mining with by looking at the total hashrate by clicking <a href="https://btc.com/stats/pool" target="_blank">here.</a> 
                                To guess how many blocks your pool might solve in a day:
                            </p>
                                <ul>

                            <p>
                                As you can see in <strong>Table #2</strong>, the numbers are proprtionally about the same and truthfully you can pick <em>any</em> of the pools above and have similar success. The one thing you do <strong>not</strong> want to do,
                                however, is switch back and forth
                                between pools too often. This has been proven a detrimental choice to running a profitable mining operation. This is akin to timing the stock market, 99% of the time you're going to lose. Keep it simple
                                and just play the long game like the rest of Bitcoin miners and be consistent with your mining pools for extended periods of time. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Anyways, looking at SlushPool, 5 blocks mined in one day amounts to 31.25 BTC. At $49,000 USD per Bitcoin, this is equal to ~$1,500,000 USD total that will be split among the <strong>entire pool</strong> for the day.
                                Remember that your reward out of that number is proportional to the hashrate you are contributing. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you contribute 110 T/h with a single ASIC to a total pool hashrate of 6,000,000 T/h (also known as 6 E/h or exahashes); that means you will receive 0.000018%
                                of the total BTC mined that day in SlushPool. In this case
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>0.000018% of 31.25 BTC = 0.00056250 BTC <em>or</em> 56,250 Satoshis</li>

                                Assuming Bitcoin is $49,000 USD; Our daily revenue in dollars is roughly estimated to be $27.60.
                                Now that we have our projected top line revenue numbers, we have to reduce it and find our proforma net income.
                            </p>
                
                
                    <li><h3>Electricity Expenses</h3></li>
                        <p>
                            To calculate daily expenses on a single Antminer S19j Pro, we will have to determine how much power consumption it will use in 24 hours.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One miner uses 3,250 Watts of electricity. If we multiply this number by 24 hours, we will have 78,000 WattHours. We need to convert this to
                            KilowattHours by dividing it by 1,000 because there is 1,000 Watts in 1 Killowatt of power. In total we consumed 78 KilowattHours of power for the day which still
                            needs to be converted to dollars.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            78 KWh multiplied by the electricity rate of $0.10c per KWh means I would have spent $7.80 USD to operate my ASIC for one day.

                            This will vary case-by-case but if you are planning on mining in a landlords property or renting a small warehouse to start mining Bitcoin, you need to consider the cyclical nature of Bitcoin's market value. If by chance the 
                            price of Bitcoin drops to unprofitable levels, you will need to shut down your operations. The problem if this were to happen is.. well.. <em>you ain't makin' no moneys</em>. So if you would like to 
                            go this route, you absolutely have to be sure you have funds on the side to cover your ass in the event of a bear market where you can't keep your machines on. Luckily, we can figure out the breakeven-price
                            for Bitcoin to figure out at what point we need to shut down.
                        </p>
                    <li><h3>Breakeven Bitcoin Price</h3></li>
                
                        <p>
                            In order to calculate our break even price, we must add up all of our fixed costs into a total and divide it by the total number of Bitcoin mined. You can do this either per-day or per-month,
                            it's completely your preference as the math will still check out. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let's pull the daily operational costs of $7.80 in electricity and multiply that by 31 days. If you want to pay your rent with your Bitcoin (if you have a lease), 
                            factor your payment into the equation. To start, lets not assume any kind of rent payment. Looking at electricity costs only, $242 per month is your monthly obligation no matter what happens.
                            Since we already have a rough idea of how much Bitcoin we will mine every month, and we know how much our expense is every month, we can find out the break-even price for Bitcoin before 
                            we have to turn things off.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We projected earning roughly 1,743,000 Satoshis each month or 0.01743 BTC. This comes out to $854 USD revenue in one month if you sold 100% of it. Our actual cost for this Bitcoin was only $242. 
                            This could also be seen as purchasing these 1.74 million Satoshis for $242. If we use the following equation below
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <a title="Your Break Even Bitcoin Price"><li><em>Electricity Cost</em> / <em>Bitcoin Mined</em> = Bitcoin Cost-Basis (aka Break Even Price)</li></a>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Using this forumula, that means our cost basis for Bitcoin is actualy only $13,844 per Bitcoin. We can look at it as we are <em>buying Bitcoin</em> for this price. The difference is instead of buying it from the open-market
                            at the prevailing market rate, we are instead paying the energy providor while Bitcoin as a protocol subsizes us directly. This $13,844 number is the price at which if Bitcoin fell to, you would 
                            need to shut down operations. At this Bitcoin price and below, it is cheaper to acquire Bitcoin by purchasing it from the open-market rather than mining it yourself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now lets assume you have a rent payment that you would like to cover 100% of with your mining operation. All you need to do is add your rent payment to your electricity cost per month
                            and you will find the new adjusted-cost basis to cover your rent. Let's assume rent is $1,000 and the electricity rate is the exact same.
                            <br>
                            Instead of looking at it as a "break-even", this new figure would tell you what price Bitcoin would need to be in order to cover your electricity costs <em>and</em> also cover 100% of your rent payment.
                            The adjusted cost basis for this example is now $71,250 per Bitcoin in order to cover both electricity costs and a rent payment. Also remember that this is assuming you 
                            have a hashrate of 110 T/h at today's mining difficulty.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What you decide to calculate in your cost basis is strictly based upon your existing income if you have any already and your end goals. While the break-even price includes only Bitcoin's price, it does 
                            not include changes in Bitcoin mining difficulty which will reduce your reward payouts.

                            <p>
                                If you've made it this far, you're probably aware that Bitcoin's supply issuance is totally inelastic, meaning that it cannot be changed. No matter how many people decide to start mining Bitcoin,
                                the amount of Bitcoin issued every day is the exact same. Unlike gold, a rise in price does <strong>not</strong> mean more Bitcoin. The same goes if Bitcoin's price decides to fall. You must factor
                                in expected mining difficulty changes to get a more accurate reading of profitability.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The way you do this is simply putting a figure of how much more new hashrate will come online per month. On average, it is somewhere close to 4% per month. 
                                Using the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-is-the-rule-72/">rule-of-72</a>, we can predict that our reward will be cut in half every 18-months. 
                                This means if Bitcoin's price has not doubled after 18 months, mining difficulty increased 4% per month over that period of time, and we did not increase our 
                                own hashrate, then we can assume we will earn half of what we did in the first month of mining. If you're more of a visual learner, just check out <strong>Table #3</strong> below to see how this would look.

                <section id="noise" class="section">
                    <li><h2>Noise</h2></li>
                            <p>
                                One thing ASICs are notorious for is the noise their fans produce to cool their processing chips. The faster the fans are spinning, the louder they will sound. Compared to the previous Antminer Generation, the Antminer S9,
                                the newer Antminer S19j Pro's have double the fans for double the noise! So what is a good way to combat this noise, especially from the comfort of your home and without annoying your neighbors 24-hours, 7-days a week?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are two different ways to treat sound. The two methods are:
                                
                                <ul>
                                    <Strong><li>Sound Acoustics Treatment</li></Strong>
                                    <Strong><li>Sound isolation</li></Strong>
                                </ul>

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sound acoustics treatment is more so treating <em>how</em> the sound bounces while sound isolation is <em>completely</em> isolating sound to a specific area without leaks.
                                This sound isolation is what we will be focusing on as Bitcoin miners.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Sound can be compared to the water in a fish tank. You don't want any to leak right? So consider how fish tanks are designed to hold all the water. It's sealed, heavy, and non-pourous. Now imagine 
                                trying to make a fish tank with blankets and a lot of sponges instead.. it wouldn't work very well would it? The same concept applies to sound isolation. What you are looking for in making these ASICs
                                quiet is <strong>mass</strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Without mass, you can consider all of your efforts to make it quieter a total waste of time. If you want your custom enclosure that will hold your ASIC to reduce the noise produced by these fans,
                                you will need to make it a little bit <em>heavy</em> and massful. Consider using things like mass-loaded vinyls and hardwood when building your ASIC enclosure. I will include several photo examples and several
                                resources for you to read further on this here. This is the simplest explanation I can give to see real results in isolation noise coming from these devices.

                <section id="heat" class="section">
                    <li><h2>Heat</h2></li>
                        <p>
                            Heat is an important component in the efficiency of your ASICs. While the chips love to be hot, you can't allow them to get <em>too</em> hot. Generally, the easiest way to take care
                            of heat is to just create some kind of ventilation duct for your ASIC where any hot air is immediately led outdoors with no chance for the hot air to recirculate back into the intake fan. It
                            is important that you do not let much if any hot air recirulate into the intake fans, especially if you decide to build an enclosure around it. The feedback loop of hot air will ruin the performance
                            of your mining equipment and thus reducing the potential output of your operation. It's also important that you make sure the air around the ASIC is not too dirty or dusty. The bane of all 
                            computers in existence is heat and dust, so if you can manage to build an enclosure that channels heat out and also channels new clean air in, you will have far less maintenance on your ASICs to deal with.
                            Take the time to figure out what kind of design you want to go with for your application. Maybe you have an extra garage you can place your ASICs inside of or possibly a spare room in your house that 
                            is empty all the time and if you were to have a guest you can just turn things off for a couple nights. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another note: Too cold is also very bad! This is actually worse for your ASICs than the hot air because cold temperatures will produce condensation and moisture is very very <strong>very</strong>
                            bad for these devices. Any kind of water build up could result in rust forming on your hashboards so it is crucial that you make sure you have some kind of backup heat generation if you happen
                            to live in a colder than usual climate. If this is your case, it isn't a terrible idea to recirculate some of that hot air coming out of the exhaust back into the ASIC to keep things warm.
                            This is the <strong>only</strong> situation that this is considered normal to do.

                            All you will need to connect your ASICs to the mining pool of your choice is an ethernet cable and a mostly stable internet connection. 
                            When you power-on for the first time, it is likely you will have to press a "reset" button for the ASIC to pickup your connection. Once you do that, you will need to have an
                            IP scanner to find your ASIC Ip address. This Ip address is how you will access your ASIC's <strong>GUI</strong> or <strong>G</strong>raphical <strong>U</strong>ser <strong>I</strong>nterface. 
                            Access to this only works if you are connected to the same internet connection as your ASIC. This is 
                            where you will find all of the hardware and pool settings for you to change and route your Bitcoin miner to. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because there are so many tutorials for this, I will not go too far into detail about this here. Here is a video explaining how to do this in more detail.

                        <p>
                            Depending on the ASIC that you choose, you may have a choice to change the ASIC firmware beyond what the OEM settings are. Similar to car manufacturers who sell their vehicles
                            with reduced power figures, Bitmain and MicroBT like to underclock or "underperform" their ASICs from factory for reliability purposes. It's not until you take your car to a special
                            auto-tuner that you can squeeze some extra power out of it. The same thing applies to ASICs with custom firmware. SlushPool is the most notorious for boosting hashrate in your ASICs with
                            a firmware by the name of <strong>Braiins OS+</strong>. This firmware is able to boost the efficiency of most ASICs, predominantly the previous generation Antminer S9. They are currently working
                            on rolling out the same firmware to the newer Antminer Antminer S19j Pro but there is a lot of technical things that need to be solved that I couldn't begin to explain to you here. Eventually, however,
                            this will be available for everyone to use. The best part about this is you can expect to produce <strong>more Bitcoin</strong> while consuming <strong>less power</strong>. This is a win win scenario.
                            Here is a video tutorial by SlushPool explaining how to install their BOS Toolbox that will make it easy for you to install this firmware to ALL of your ASICs with ease. I
